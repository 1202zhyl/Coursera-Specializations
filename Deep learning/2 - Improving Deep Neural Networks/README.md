# Improving Deep Neural Networks (Course 2)

This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. 
Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, 
and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow. 

Week 1 - Practical Aspects of Deep Learning <br>
Week 2 - Optimization Algorithms <br>
Week 3 - Hyperparameter tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks <br>
